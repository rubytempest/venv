Introduction
================================================================================
**pyexcel-handsontable** is a rendering plugin to
`pyexcel <http://pyexcel.readthedocs.org/en/latest>`_  and renders
`pyexcel.Sheet` and `pyexcel.Book` into a
`handsontable <https://handsontable.com>`_ in your web page. As long as you
have a browser, you could view the data. However, please note
that this library does not aim to replace any current excel softwares, such
as Micorsoft Office. But it aims to extends the capability of a
Python user/developer in viewing plain data.


Main features:

#. transform your excel sheets into excel alike html file.
#. embed your excel sheets into your web page.
#. show your data like excel in jupyter notebook (added in 0.0.2).

Here is one liner to use it with pyexcel:

.. code-block:: python

    import pyexcel as p

    p.save_as(file_name='your.xls', dest_file_name='your.handsontable.html')

Alternatively, you can use this library with pyexcel cli module::


    $ pip install pyexcel-cli
    $ pyexcel transcode your.xls your.handsontable.html


Please remember to give this file suffix always: **handsontable.html**. It is because `handsontable.html` triggers this plugin in pyexcel.

Installation
================================================================================

You can install pyexcel-handsontable via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install pyexcel-handsontable


or clone it and install it:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/pyexcel-renderers/pyexcel-handsontable.git
    $ cd pyexcel-handsontable
    $ python setup.py install



Development guide
================================================================================

Development steps for code changes

#. git clone https://github.com/pyexcel/pyexcel-handsontable.git
#. cd pyexcel-handsontable

Upgrade your setup tools and pip. They are needed for development and testing only:

#. pip install --upgrade setuptools pip

Then install relevant development requirements:

#. pip install -r rnd_requirements.txt # if such a file exists
#. pip install -r requirements.txt
#. pip install -r tests/requirements.txt

Once you have finished your changes, please provide test case(s), relevant documentation
and update CHANGELOG.rst.

.. note::

    As to rnd_requirements.txt, usually, it is created when a dependent
    library is not released. Once the dependecy is installed
    (will be released), the future
    version of the dependency in the requirements.txt will be valid.


How to test your contribution
------------------------------

Although `nose` and `doctest` are both used in code testing, it is adviable that unit tests are put in tests. `doctest` is incorporated only to make sure the code examples in documentation remain valid across different development releases.

On Linux/Unix systems, please launch your tests like this::

    $ make

On Windows systems, please issue this command::

    > test.bat

How to update test environment and update documentation
---------------------------------------------------------

Additional steps are required:

#. pip install moban
#. git clone https://github.com/moremoban/setupmobans.git # generic setup
#. git clone https://github.com/pyexcel/pyexcel-commons.git commons
#. make your changes in `.moban.d` directory, then issue command `moban`

What is pyexcel-commons
---------------------------------

Many information that are shared across pyexcel projects, such as: this developer guide, license info, etc. are stored in `pyexcel-commons` project.

What is .moban.d
---------------------------------

`.moban.d` stores the specific meta data for the library.

Acceptance criteria
-------------------

#. Has Test cases written
#. Has all code lines tested
#. Passes all Travis CI builds
#. Has fair amount of documentation if your change is complex
#. Please update CHANGELOG.rst
#. Please add yourself to CONTRIBUTORS.rst
#. Agree on NEW BSD License for your contribution


Update styles
--------------------

`styles/style.scss` control the look and feel of the frame. In order to view the changes
in that file, you will need to compile, moban and install it. Here is the sequence
of commands::

    $ make css
    $ moban
    $ python setup.py install
    $ make -C demo

Then please open handsontable.html from demo directory.
